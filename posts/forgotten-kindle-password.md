We had an old Kindle lying around, and no one could remember the passcode for it.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

I share the good news about [1Password](https://1password.com) with all who will listen. But some accounts and devices I encounter were configured before I was able to encourage good password practices. This old Kindle was locked behind a forgotten passcode but otherwise seemed to be in working order. We'd tried to navigate the dizzying support options on Amazon's site but couldn't find a solution.

A Google search led me to [this post](https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2016/06/04/how-to-fix-your-kindle-if-you-forget-the-passcode/) containing the answer: "type 111222777 into the passcode entry field to reset your Kindle to factory settings."

Of course, we'd lost all content on the device, but since we couldn't access it anyway, it seemed like a fair tradeoff.

Don't be a mean person; use this information responsibly.
